# Institute for Justice and Journalism (Archive)

These repos are now Read-Only since Institute for Justice and Journalism (IJJ) no longer exists.

These projects were developed during Migrahack hackathons funded and organized by IJJ where I, ([Lucio Villa](https://github.com/luciovilla/)), helped mentor attendees and collected these projects.

From [Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2013/migrahack-brings-together-journalists-programmers-and-community/):

```
Migrahack takes the collaborative culture of hackathons and applies it to the difficult work of making sense of immigration data. And it does so with three distinct groups — journalists, programmers and community members, usually drawn from community non-profits. Participants gather for an intense few days to look at an already prepared set of immigration data and, together, figure out what they might do with it.

[Claudia] Nuñez created Migrahack in 2012 after experiencing hackathons at Stanford, where she was a Knight fellow, that were mostly filled with white male programmers. Nuñez, a third-generation Mexican journalist, wanted to bring communities of color and journalists together with the tech people and see what might happen. L.A. Migrahack ran in 2012, with some funding from the Institute for Justice & Journalism. (Migrahacks are now a project of IJJ.) Chicago Migrahack followed this year, and Mexico City is scheduled for spring 2014.
